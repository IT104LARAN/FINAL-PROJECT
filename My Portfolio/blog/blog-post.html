            <h2>Understanding Mental Health: Importance and Tips for Well-being
            </h2>
            <p>In recent years, conversations around mental health have become 
                increasingly prevalent as society recognizes the importance of 
                emotional well-being. Mental health encompasses our emotional, 
                psychological, and social well-being, affecting how we think, feel,
                 and behave in daily life. It also influences how we handle stress, relate to others, 
                 and make choices.</p>

                 <h2>Why Mental Health Matters</h2>
                 <p>Maintaining good mental health is crucial for 
                    overall health and quality of life. 
                    It impacts every aspect of our existence, 
                    from our relationships and work performance to 
                    physical health and ability to cope with challenges. 
                    Here are some key reasons why mental health matters:</p>
                    
                   <h3><strong>Overall Well-being:</strong></h3>
                   <p>Mental health influences our overall well-being and quality of life.
                    <p>It's not just the absence of mental illness but also includes emotional resilience,
                    satisfaction with life, and the ability to cope with stress.
                   </p>
                   <h3><strong>Physical Health:</strong></h3>
                   <p>Mental health impacts physical health.
                    Poor mental health can contribute to physical health problems like heart disease, 
                    weakened immune system, and chronic conditions.
